## [LibNepNep]

### What is libNepNep?
LibNepNep is the library I'm building for save editing while I learn about the savefiles themselfs. The lib is located in the "libNepNep" folder.

### Can I build libNepNep?
Yes! - If you want, you can built from the makefile inside the folder - Windows support will come, don't worry ;)

LibNepNep is dependent on a collection of headers called the [RPCommonLib](https://github.com/AnzoDK/RPCommonLib) which can be quickly downloaded.
